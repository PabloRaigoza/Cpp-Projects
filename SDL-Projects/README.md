This directory contians projects using SDL 'libraries'.

SDL is Simple Directmedia Layer. SDL allows you to open windows, and render colors and/or images to them. SDL is also VERY cross platform.
It also keeps track of keyboard, mouse, touch, and controller events.
All of these combine to make a  simple way to create simulations and games, particuraly in a 2D exerpience as oppsed to 3D.

Here I made games, simulations, and plenty other projects. 
NOTE: I will be using Linux headers in my projects, so you need to use your system's headers.



If you would like to run the projects you would need to head over to the SDL website and download SDL 2.0
