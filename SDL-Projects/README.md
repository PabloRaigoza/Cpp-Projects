This directory contians projects using SDL 'libraries'.

SDL is Simple Directmedia Layer. SDL allows you to open windows, and render colors and/or images to them. SDL is also VERY cross platform.
It also keeps track of keyboard, mouse, touch, and controller events.
All of these combine to make a  simple way to create simulations and games, particuraly in a 2D exerpience as oppsed to 3D.

Here I made games, simulations, and plenty other projects.



If you would like to run the projects you would need to head over to the SDL website and download SDL 2.0
